# Rule gallery

This page gives examples of rules that can be used either with ArboratorGrew and when writing more complex [GRS](../grs).

# Tokenisation


## Splitting a punctuation mark at the end of a token
This example below splits the tokenisation signs which were kept on the previous word.

Note that the new punctuation is not attached. It should be attached manually after or with a rule like **TODO**.

## Splitting a token in sub-tokens and adding a Multi-Word token

UD proposes a mechanism for dealing with difficult tokenisation examples (see [UD guidelines](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes)).
This mechanism is called a Multi-Word Token (MWT).
The rule above shows how to split a token into sub tokens by adding a MWT to the structure.
The first example corresponds to the French contraction _au_, which should be split into _Ã _ and _le_.
Note that the rule does not handle the dependency relations, so the output of the rule should be edited for a full annotation.
