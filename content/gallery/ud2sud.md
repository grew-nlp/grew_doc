# Conversion from UD to SUD

This example presents a simplified version of the conversion from UD to SUD.

The conversion of the UD annotated sentence:

![UD](/gallery/ud2sud/_build/ud.svg)

into the SUD annotation:

![SUD](/gallery/ud2sud/_build/sud.svg)

is realised by the following [GRS](../ud2sud/ud2sud.grs):

## Grew code
{{< grew file="/static/gallery/ud2sud/ud2sud.grs" >}}
