# Grew ‚Ä¢ Command Line Interface

The command used to run **Grew** is: `grew <subcommand> [<args>]`

The 5 main subcommands are:

  * [:link:](./#transform) `transform`: application of a rewriting system to a set of graphs
  * [:link:](./#grep)`grep`: search for a request in a corpus
  * [:link:](./#count) `count`: compute stats of a set of requests in a set of corpora)
  * [:link:](./#compile) `compile`: compile a set of corpora
  * [:link:](./#clean)`clean`: clean a set of corpora

Other subcommands:

  * `version`: Print version numbers of the **Grew** Ocaml library and of the **Grew** tool
  * `help`: Print general help
  * `help <subcommand>`:  Print help for the given subcommand

There are two modes of input data: **Mono** corpus or **Multi** corpora. See [here](../input) for more details about input formats.

The table below shows what are the accepted input modes for the main subcommands.

|             | `transform` | `grep` | `count` | `compile` | `clean` |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **Mono**    |     ‚úÖ      |     ‚úÖ     |     ‚úÖ (üÜï in `1.10`)      |     ‚ùå     |     ‚ùå     |
| **Multi**   |     ‚ùå      |     ‚úÖ (üÜï in `1.10`)     |     ‚úÖ     |     ‚úÖ     |     ‚úÖ     |

The table below shows what are the ouptut mode modes for the 3 main subcommands (`compile` and `clean` does not have any output).

|                | CLI arg |  `transform` | `grep` | `count` |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **CoNLL-U**    |   ‚àÖ   |     ‚úÖ (default)      |     ‚ùå     |     ‚ùå     |
| **JSON**       | `-json` |     ‚úÖ      |     ‚úÖ (default)    |     ‚úÖ (default)    |
| **CoNLL-X**    | `-cupt` /  `-semcor` / `-columns ‚Ä¶`  |     ‚úÖ      |     ‚ùå     |     ‚ùå     |
| **DOT**        | `-dot` |     ‚úÖ      |     ‚ùå     |     ‚ùå     |
| **multi JSON** | `-multi_json` |     ‚úÖ      |     ‚ùå    |     ‚ùå    |
| **TSV**        | `-tsv` |     ‚ùå      |     ‚ùå     |     ‚úÖ ([in some cases](./#count))    |

# Transform

In this mode, **Grew** apply a Graph Rewriting System to a graph or a set of graphs.

The full command for this mode:

`grew transform [<args>]`

All arguments are optional:

 * `-grs <grs_file>`: the main file which describes the Graph Rewriting System. If no GRS is given, the empty GRS is loaded: `strat main {Seq ()}`
 * `-i <input_file>`: describes the input data (CoNLL file of gr file).
 If no input file is given, **Grew** reads from `stdin`
 * `-o <output_file>`: is the name of the output file (CoNLL file). If no output file is given, **Grew** writes to `stdout`
 * `-strat <name>`: the strategy used in transformation (default value: `main`)
 * `-safe_commands`: flag. It makes rewriting process fail in case of [ineffective command](../../doc/commands/#effective-commands)
 * `-config`: See [here](#-config)

---
# Grep

This mode corresponds to the command line version of the [Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr) tool.
The clustering is also available [:link:](./#with-clustering) in the grep mode.

## Without clustering

The command is:

`grew grep -request <request_file> -i <input>`

where:

  * `<request_file>` is a file which describes a request
  * `<input>` describes the data on which the search is done
    * one corpus (**Mono** mode); in this case, the optionnal `-config` parameter ([see here](#-config)) can also be used
    * a set of corpora (**Multi** mode)

The output is given in JSON format.

### Example with **Mono** input

With the following files:

 * The corpus `UD_French-PUD` version 2.11: `fr_pud-ud-test.conllu`[:link:](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French-PUD/blob/r2.11/fr_pud-ud-test.conllu?raw=true)
 * A request file with the code below: `dislocated.req`[:link:](/usage/cli/dislocated.req)

{{< grew file="static/usage/cli/dislocated.req" >}}

**NB**: the fact the edge from `M` to `N` is given an identifier `e` will give the information about this edge in the output (see below).

The command:

```
grew grep -request dislocated.req -i fr_pud-ud-test.conllu
```

produces the following JSON output:

{{< json file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_grep" >}}

This means that the request described in the file `dislocated.req` was found three times in the corpus, each item gives the sentence identifier and the position of the nodes and the edges matched by the request.

Note that two other options exist:

 * `-html`: produces a new `html` field in each JSON item with the sentence where words impacted by the request are in a special HTML span with class `highlight`
 * `-dep_dir <directory>`: produces a new file in the folder `directory` with the representation of the sentence with highlighted part (as in [Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr) tool) and a new field in each JSON item with the filename; the output is in `dep` format (usable with [Dep2pict](http://dep2pict.loria.fr)).

### Example with **Multi** input

With the **Mutli** mode data described in the example file `en_fr_zh.json` [:link:](/usage/cli/en_fr_zh.json) (which must be compiled with `grew compile -i en_fr_zh.json`)
{{< json file="static/usage/cli/en_fr_zh.json" >}}

The command:

```
grew grep -request dislocated.req -i en_fr_zh.json
```

produces the following JSON output:

{{< json file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_grep_multi" >}}


## With clustering

In both modes **Mono** and **Multi**, if the command line additionally contains one or more arguments (`-key ‚Ä¶` or `-whether ‚Ä¶`),
the set of occurrences is recursively clusterised following the given clustering items.

See the [clustering documentation page](../../doc/clustering) for details about the different existing clustering items.

### Examples

With the same files as in the *without clustering* example above.

With `-key`, we can cluster the results according to the `upos` of the node `N` (the dependent).

```
grew grep -request dislocated.req -key N.upos -i fr_pud-ud-test.conllu
```

{{< json file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_grep_key" >}}

With `-whether`, we can cluster the results according to the fact that the relation left-headed.
We observe that in two cases, the governor `M` is before `N`.

```
grew grep -request dislocated.req -whether "M << N" -i fr_pud-ud-test.conllu
```

{{< json file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_grep_whether" >}}


Finally, several clustering can be applied successively. For instance

```
grew grep -request dislocated.req -key N.upos -whether "M << N" -i fr_pud-ud-test.conllu
```

{{< json file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_grep_key_whether" >}}

### Remarks:
 * any longer sequence of `-key ‚Ä¶` or `-whether ‚Ä¶` can be used
 * the relative order of clutering items is relevant (try `grew grep -request dislocated.req -whether "M << N" -key N.upos -i fr_pud-ud-test.conllu`)
 * it is possible to combine **Multi** mode and clustering: `grew grep -request dislocated.req -key N.upos -whether "M << N" -i en_fr_zh.json`

# Count

This mode computes corpus statistics based on **Grew-match** style requests.

The input data are:
 - one (**Mono** mode) or several (**Multi** mode) corpora
 - one or several requests
 - any number of clustering item (either key of whether)

By defalut, it returns a JSON describing several embedded dictionaries, counting in each corpus, each request clustered following clustering items.

If the output dimension is 2, the statistics can be printed as a TSV table.
This is the case for:
 * **Mono** mode, any number of requests, 1 clustering item (üÜï in `1.10`)
 * **Multi** mode, any number of requests, no clustering items &rarr; a TSV table is built with the number of occurrences for each request in each corpus.
 * **Multi** mode, 1 request, 1 clustering item &rarr; a TSV table is built with the results of the clustering (with corpora on lines and values of the cluster key in rows).

The optionnal `-config` parameter ([see here](#-config)) can also be used.



TODO: The set of corpora is described in a [JSON file](../../doc/corpora) and must be [compiled](./#compile) before running `grew count`.


## Example with **Multi** mode, several requests and no clustering
Each request is described in a separate file.
With the two following 1-line files:

 * `ADJ_NOUN_pre.req` [:link:](/usage/cli/ADJ_NOUN_pre.req) {{< grew file="static/usage/cli/ADJ_NOUN_pre.req" >}}
 * `ADJ_NOUN_post.req` [:link:](/usage/cli/ADJ_NOUN_post.req) {{< grew file="static/usage/cli/ADJ_NOUN_post.req" >}}

and the Multi mode file `en_fr_zh.json` [:link:](/usage/cli/en_fr_zh.json)
{{< input file="static/usage/cli/en_fr_zh.json" >}}

After compiling the corpora: `grew compile -i en_fr_zh.json`

The command `grew count -request ADJ_NOUN_pre.req -request ADJ_NOUN_post.req -i en_fr_zh.json`
outputs the JSON data:

{{< json file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_count.json" >}}

And, with `-tsv` option: `grew count -request ADJ_NOUN_pre.req -request ADJ_NOUN_post.req -i en_fr_zh.json -tsv`

{{< input file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_count.tsv" >}}

which corresponds to the table:

| Corpus | ADJ_NOUN | NOUN_ADJ |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| UD_English-PUD | 1114 | 12 |
| UD_French-PUD | 423 | 935 |
| UD_Chinese-PUD | 364 | 0 |

We can then observe that in the annotations of the 3 corpora in use:

 * in French, there is a weak preference for adjective position after the noun (68.9%)
 * in English, there is a strong preference for adjective position before the noun (98.9%)
 * in Chinese, there is a **very** strong preference for adjective position before the noun (100%)

## Example with **Multi** mode, one request and a key clustering of the output

With the same data as in the previous example, the following command:

`grew count -request ADJ_NOUN_pre.req -key N.Number -i en_fr_zh.json -tsv`

produces the TSV file:

{{< input file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_count_key.tsv" >}}

which corresponds to the table:

| Corpus | Plur | Sing | undefined |
|------------|-------------|----------|----|
| UD_English-PUD | 392 | 722 | 0 |
| UD_French-PUD | 178 | 245 | 0 |
| UD_Chinese-PUD | 0 | 0 | 364 |

## Example with **Multi** mode, one request and a whether clustering of the output

Using a whether clustering, with the request `ADJ_NOUN.req` [:link:](/usage/cli/ADJ_NOUN.req) 
{{< input file="static/usage/cli/ADJ_NOUN.req" >}}

and the command: `grew count -request ADJ_NOUN.req -whether "A << N" -i en_fr_zh.json -tsv`

we obtain the TSV file:

{{< input file="static/usage/cli/_build/output_count_whether.tsv" >}}

which corresponds to the table:

| Corpus | No | Yes |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| UD_English-PUD | 12 | 1114 |
| UD_French-PUD | 935 | 423 |
| UD_Chinese-PUD | 0 | 364 |


## Remarks

 * Only one request is used in case of clustering.
 * Request syntax can be learned [here](/doc/request/) or with the online **[Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr)** tool, first with the [tutorial](http://match.grew.fr?tutorial=yes) and then with snippets given on the right of the text area.
 * If some corpus is updated, it is necessary to run again the compilation step.
 * Some requests may take a long time to be searched in corpora.
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è In previous version (< `1.10`), the TSV table also contains a column with the size of corpora (in number of sentences). This column is no longer available in version `1.10`.

# Compile

For the Grew-match backend (`grew_match_back`) or for the command `grew count`, it is required to first compile corpora.
For these two usages, sets of corpora are described in a [JSON file](../../doc/corpora).

For compilation, the command is:

`grew compile -i <corpora.json>`

Note that this produces, for each corpus, a new file with the `.marshal` extension stored in the corpus directory.
The `.marshal` file is computed only if the corpus has changed since the last compilation.

---
# Clean

The commands below removes the `marshal` files produced by the `grew compile` command for the set of corpora described in the [JSON file](../../doc/corpora) `corpora.json`.

`grew clean -i <corpora.json>`


---
# Parameters

This section describes a few command line arguments that are shared by several commands.

## `-config`
The config value can be: `ud`, `sud`, `sequoia` or `basic`. The default value is `ud`.

This parameter modifies how CoNNL-U and GRS files are interpreted.
More precisely, it controls:
  * How edge labels are parsed (for instance, taking `@` extension into account in SUD). See [here](../../doc/graph#edges) for a detailled description about this.
  * How features are stored in CoNLL-U (columns FEATS or columns MISC). See [here](../../doc/conllu#how-the-misc-field-is-handled-by-grew) for details.

This parameter is used in the `transform`, `grep` and `count` modes.
