# Grew Tutorial • Lesson 1 • Matching

The graph matching used in **Grew** is the same as the one used in **Grew-match**.
In order to learn the **Grew** syntax for writing patterns, please follow the [Grew-match tutorial](http://match.grew.fr?tutorial=Yes) (lessons 1 to 4, the lesson 5 is specific to **Grew-match** and not relevant in **Grew**).
