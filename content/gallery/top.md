## [Single-headed structure and chained structure](../flat)

There are two main ways for encoding of *fixed* construction in dependencies:

 * Single-headed structure where each item (but the first) is linked to the first item
 * Chained structure where each item (but the first) is linked to the previous item

[This example](../flat) presents discuss **Grew** rules which can be used for the transformation on one encoding to the other.

## [Extract connected components](../connected_components)

[This page](../connected_components) describes a Graph Rewriting System which turn a graph in the set of its connected components.

## [Compute spans](../span)

[This page](../span) illustrates the usage of non-injective matching.
