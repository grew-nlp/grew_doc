# GRS syntax

In Grew, rewriting rules are described in a GRS file (GRS stands for Graph Rewriting System).

A GRS file describes a set of modules, each module contains a set of [rules](../rule).

:warning: Files using this format are expected to used the `.grs` file extension.


A Grew Graph Rewriting System (GRS) is defined by:

  * a optional domain definition
  * a set of modules (each module is introduced by the keyword `module`)
  * the definition of sequences of modules (keyword `sequences`)

## Domain definition
The domain is defined as a pair of a feture domain and an edge label domain.

### Feature domain
In graphs and in rules, nodes contain feature structures.
To control these feature structures, a feature domain may be given first.
In the feature domain declaration, feature names are identifiers and are defined as:

  * **closed** feature accepts only an explicit given set of possible values (like the cat feature value below);
  * **open** feature name accepts any string value (like the lemma feature value below);
  * **numerical** feature (like the position feature below).

In closed feature definition, feature values can be any strings; double quotes are required for string that are not lexical identifier (like values for pers).

~~~grew
features {
  cat: n, np, v, adj;
  mood: inf, ind, subj, pastp, presp;
  lemma: *;
  phon: *;
  pers: "1","2","3";
  position: #;
}
~~~

**REM:** values of pers feature are numerals but the only way to restrict to the finite domain {1, 2, 3} is to declare it as a closed feature and possible values as strings.

### edge labe domain
An explicit set of valid labels for edges may be given after the `labels` keyword.

By default, edges are drawn with a black solid line and above the figure in DEP representation.

To modify the color or the position of the edges, the user can add attributes to a label with suffixes:

   `@bottom` to put the label above
   `@red`, `@blue`, â€¦ to modify the color of the link and the label
   `@dot` or `@dash` to modify the style of the link

Several suffixes can be used simultaneously.

~~~grew
labels { OBJ, SUJ, DE_OBJ, ANT, ANT_REL@red, ANT_REP@blue@bottom@dash }
~~~


## Modules

In Grew, rules are grouped in modules.
A module is defined by a name and a set of [rules](../rule).

Example of module:

~~~grew
module name {
  rule r_1 {
    ...
  }

  rule r_2 {
    ...
  }

}
~~~

A module can be declared as `deterministic`:

~~~grew
module deterministic mod_name { ... }
~~~

If a module is declared deterministic, then only one normal form is computed.
If a non-confluent module is declared deterministic, some normal forms may be lost!

## Sequences

In the sequences part of a GRS file, each sequence is described by a name and a list of modules.
The same module can be used in several sequences but it can also be used several times in the same sequence
(mainly useful when total ordering of module is not possible).

## examples of GRS
A minimal GRS file (without any module) looks like:

~~~grew
features {
  cat: v, np;
  phon: *;
  lemma: *;
}

labels { suj, obj }

sequences { dummy {} }
~~~

A bigger grs file:
~~~grew
features { ... }

labels { OBJ, SUBJ, DE_OBJ, ANT }

module det {

  rule det_1 {
    ...
  }

  rule det_2 {
    ...
  }
}

...

module ana {
  ...
}

sequences {
  full {det; normsyn; arg; ana}  
  dn {det; normsyn}
}
~~~


## Split a GRS description into several files

It is possible to describe a GRS through several text files.

### External domain

The two declarations of features domain and of labels domain can be putted in a separate file and include in the main GRS with the keyword `domain`

### External module definition
It is also possible to put a list of modules in a external file `modules_1_and_2.grs`:

~~~grew
module M1 { ... }

module M2 { ... }
~~~

and to include them in a GRS file with the syntax below:

~~~grew
include "modules_1_and_2.grs";
~~~
The recursive use of the include directive is available.
