# Graph Rewriting for NLP

**Grew** is a Graph Rewriting tool dedicated to applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It can manipulate many kinds of linguistic representation. It has been used on POS-tagged sequence, surface dependency syntax, deep dependency syntax, semantic representation (AMR, DMRS) but it can be used to represent any graph-based structure.

There is a mailing list `grew@inria.fr` for announcement or discussion related to Grew.

## News
 * ðŸ†• **2023/03/24:** Version **1.12**. See [What's new](/whats_new/) for changes.

 * **2023/01/22:** Version **1.11**.

 * **2022/11/23:** Version **1.10**.
 
## A first taste of Grew
The easiest way to try and test **Grew** is to use one of the online interfaces.

  1. [Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr): Online graph matching to search for a given request in a corpus of syntactic structures (a [tutorial](http://match.grew.fr/?tutorial=yes) is available to help learning request syntax).
  2. [Grew-web](https://web.grew.fr): Online graph rewriting
  2. [Arborator-Grew](https://arborator.github.io/): Tool for online corpus management (this is another tool, using Grew as backend)

## Some of the main features of Grew

  * Graph structures can use a built-in notion of **feature structures**.
  * The left-hand side of a rule is described by a graph called a **request** (or **patterns**); injective graph morphisms are used in the pattern matching algorithm.
  * **Negative pattern** can be used for a finer control on the left-hand side of rules.
  * The right-hand side of rules is described by a sequence of **atomic commands** that describe how the graph should be modified during the rule application.
  * Subset of rules can be organised in **packages** and **strategies** define the way rules and packages are applied in graph transformation.
  * **Grew** has support both for **confluent** and **non-confluent** modules; when a non-confluent modules is used, all normal forms are returned and then ambiguity is handled in a natural way.
