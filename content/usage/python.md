# Grewpy â€¢ Python library

:warning: The [previous library](../python_2018) described in the [book](https://www.wiley.com/en-fr/Application+of+Graph+Rewriting+to+Natural+Language+Processing-p-9781119522348) is deprecated. Please refer to the documentation on this page for uptodate information. 

## Install

If you don' have already installed some **Grew** related software or library, follow steps 1 and 2 on [this page](../install).

 - `opam update`
 - `opam install grewpy_backend`
 - `pip install grewpy` (`pip` may be replaced by `pip3` depending on your local installation)

Test the installation with `echo "import grewpy" | python`. It should output `connected to port: 8888` (or a higher port number if `8888` is already used.)

## Upgrade

1. `opam update && opam install grewpy_backend`
2. `pip install grewpy --upgrade`

The latest version of `grewpy_backend` is 0.1.3. You can check your version with `opam list | grep grewpy`

The latest version of `grewpy` is 0.1.2. You can check your version with `pip3 show grewpy`
